Here are some basic coding questions related to Java that are commonly asked in interviews at many companies.
1.Reverse a String:
Write a Java program to reverse a given string.

2.Find the Factorial of a Number:
Implement a Java program to calculate the factorial of a number.

3.Check if a String is a Palindrome:
Write a Java function to determine whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

4.Find the Largest Element in an Array:
Develop a Java function to find the largest element in an array.

5.Reverse an Array:
Write a Java program to reverse the order of elements in an array.

6.Check for Prime Numbers:

7.Fibonacci Series:
Write a Java program to generate the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

8.Bubble Sort:
Create a Java program to sort an array using the bubble sort algorithm.

9.Calculate the Sum of Digits:
Write a Java function to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number.

10.Check if Two Strings are Anagrams:
Implement a Java function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
